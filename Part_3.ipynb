    "8. Example 1: Causal Analysis on Primary Dataset (Synthetic Medical Study)\n",
    "\n",
    "8.1 Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "For our primary worked example, we utilize a high-fidelity Synthetic Medical Dataset representing a Type 2 Diabetes treatment study. Using synthetic data allows us to define the \"Ground Truth\" causal effect explicitly (which is impossible in real-world data), enabling us to objectively verify if our causal inference methods successfully remove bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenario:\n",
    "We observe 1,000 patients who either received a new_drug or standard care.\n",
    "\n",
    "Source: Generated procedurally within this notebook to ensure reproducibility and stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relevance: This mimics a classic Observational Study where Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are not feasible. In such studies, \"Confounding by Indication\" is common—doctors tend to prescribe new, stronger treatments to patients who are already sicker or older.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable Definitions:Treatment ($T$): new_drug (Binary: 1 if treated, 0 if control).Outcome ($Y$): hba1c_reduction (Continuous: Reduction in blood sugar levels; higher is better).Confounders ($W$):age: Older patients are more likely to receive the drug.bmi: Body Mass Index.severity: Baseline disease severity (Sicker patients are more likely to receive the drug).\n",
    "\n",
    "8.2 Problem Setup \n",
    "\n",
    "Causal Question: Does the new_drug cause a greater reduction in HbA1c levels compared to standard care, after adjusting for patient characteristics?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bias Mechanism: The data generation process introduces intentional Selection Bias. The probability of receiving the drug (prob_drug) is positively correlated with age and severity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis: A Naive Comparison (simple difference in means) will underestimate the drug's effectiveness because the treated group starts with a disadvantage (they are older and sicker). A Causal Model using Propensity Score Stratification should correct this bias and recover the true effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.3 Step-by-Step Causal Analysis We will perform the analysis using the DoWhy library following these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Generation & Exploration: Generate the data with a known Ground Truth Effect of 1.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Estimation: Calculate $E[Y|T=1] - E[Y|T=0]$ to demonstrate the magnitude of the bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modeling: Define a Causal Graph (DAG) identifying age, bmi, and severity as common causes (confounders) of both new_drug and hba1c_reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Identification: Use the Backdoor Criterion to identify the causal effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Estimation: Apply Propensity Score Stratification. This method estimates the probability of treatment (propensity score) for each patient, groups them into strata of similar probabilities, and computes the effect within these balanced groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Refutation: Perform a Placebo Treatment Test. We replace the true treatment with a random variable. A robust model should return an effect estimate of 0 (p-value > 0.05), indicating it is not finding patterns in random noise."
