    "Topic 1: Foundational Concepts (Confounding, DAGs, & Bias)\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 1: The Fundamental Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: Which of the following best describes the \"Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "A) We cannot control for all confounding variables in an observational study.\n",
    "\n",
    "B) We can never observe both the treated ($Y_1$) and untreated ($Y_0$) potential outcomes for the same individual simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "C) Correlation never implies causation, even in randomized trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "D) Machine learning models always overfit when applied to causal tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer: B\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: The fundamental problem is that for any given unit, we only observe the outcome for the treatment they actually received. The counterfactual outcome is always missing, making individual-level causal effects impossible to measure directly without assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 2: Confounders vs. Colliders\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: In a Causal Graph (DAG), you are interested in the effect of $X$ on $Y$. There is a third variable $Z$. $X$ causes $Z$, and $Y$ also causes $Z$ ($X \\rightarrow Z \\leftarrow Y$). What type of variable is $Z$, and should you control for it?\n",
    "\n",
    "A) $Z$ is a Confounder; you must control for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "B) $Z$ is a Mediator; you must control for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "C) $Z$ is a Collider; controlling for it opens a backdoor path and introduces bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "D) $Z$ is an Instrument; you should use it to estimate the effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer: C\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: $Z$ is a collider because arrows from both the treatment and outcome point into it. Conditioning on a collider (e.g., selection bias) creates a spurious association between $X$ and $Y$, confusing the causal signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 3: Selection Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: A study finds that people who take Vitamin C supplements live longer than those who don't. However, people who take supplements also tend to exercise more and smoke less. If we attribute the longer life solely to Vitamin C, what error have we committed?\n",
    "\n",
    "A) Overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "B) Selection Bias / Confounding\n",
    "\n",
    "C) Measurement Error\n",
    "\n",
    "D) Simpson's Paradox\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer: B\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: Selection bias occurs when the treated group (vitamin takers) differs systematically from the control group in ways that also affect the outcome (health). The \"effect\" is likely driven by the healthy behaviors (confounders), not the vitamin itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 4: Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: Why are Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) considered the \"gold standard\" for causal inference?\n",
    "\n",
    "A) They recruit more participants than observational studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "B) Randomization ensures that, on average, treatment and control groups are identical on both observed and unobserved characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "C) They eliminate the need for statistical significance testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "D) They allow us to observe the counterfactual for every individual.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer: B\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: Random assignment breaks the link between confounders and treatment. Since treatment is assigned by chance, neither motivation, health status, nor any other factor can influence who gets treated, eliminating selection bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 5: Simpson's Paradox\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: A university sees that Department A admits a higher percentage of men than women, and Department B also admits a higher percentage of men than women. However, when combined, the university admits a higher percentage of women overall. This phenomenon is known as:\n",
    "\n",
    "A) The Law of Large Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "B) Simpson's Paradox\n",
    "\n",
    "C) The Backdoor Criterion\n",
    "\n",
    "D) Collider Stratification Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer: B\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: Simpson's Paradox occurs when a trend appears in different groups of data but disappears or reverses when these groups are combined. It usually indicates that a confounder (e.g., department difficulty) is influencing the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic 2: Propensity Score Matching (Application)\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 6: Propensity Score Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: Mathematically, what is the Propensity Score $e(x)$?\n",
    "\n",
    "A) The probability of the outcome occurring given the treatment: $P(Y=1 | T=1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "B) The probability of receiving the treatment given the covariates: $P(T=1 | X)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "C) The difference in means between treated and control groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "D) The probability that the treatment causes the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer: B\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: The propensity score is defined as the conditional probability of assignment to a particular treatment given a vector of observed covariates. It reduces multidimensional covariates into a single scalar for matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 7: The Balancing Property\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: After performing Propensity Score Matching, you check the \"Covariate Balance\" (e.g., using a Love Plot). What are you hoping to see?\n",
    "\n",
    "A) The treated group has much higher values for covariates than the control group.\n",
    "\n",
    "B) The distribution of covariates in the matched control group is statistically similar to the treated group (Standardized Mean Difference $\\approx 0$).\n",
    "\n",
    "C) The propensity scores for all units are exactly 0.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "D) The outcome variable $Y$ is identical for both groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer: B\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: The goal of PSM is to create a synthetic control group that looks like the treated group. If balanced, the Standardized Mean Difference for confounders should be close to zero, mimicking an RCT.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 8: Common Support\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: What does the \"Common Support\" or \"Overlap\" assumption imply in Propensity Score Matching?\n",
    "\n",
    "A) Every unit in the population must have received the treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "B) There must be units in both the treated and control groups with similar propensity scores; otherwise, we cannot find matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "C) The sample size of the treated group must equal the sample size of the control group.\n",
    "\n",
    "D) The treatment effect must be positive for all individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer: B\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: We can only estimate causal effects for individuals who have a non-zero probability of being in either group. If there is no overlap (e.g., all high-income people are treated), we cannot find a valid comparison (counterfactual) and must trim the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 9: Interpreting ATT\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: You run a PSM analysis on a job training program and calculate the ATT (Average Treatment Effect on the Treated). The result is $+\\$5,000$. How do you interpret this?\n",
    "\n",
    "A) If we forced the entire population to take the training, the average income would rise by $\\$5,000$.\n",
    "\n",
    "B) For the specific individuals who chose to participate, the training increased their income by $\\$5,000$ compared to if they hadn't participated.\n",
    "\n",
    "C) The training guarantees a $\\$5,000$ raise for anyone.\n",
    "\n",
    "D) The correlation between training and income is 0.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer: B\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: The ATT specifically measures the effect for the sub-population that actually took the treatment. It does not necessarily apply to those who chose not to participate (who might benefit less).\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 10: Limitations of PSM\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: What is the major limitation of Propensity Score Matching compared to Instrumental Variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "A) PSM requires a larger sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "B) PSM assumes \"Unconfoundedness\"—it only accounts for observed variables. If there is a hidden confounder, the estimate is still biased.\n",
    "\n",
    "C) PSM cannot handle continuous outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "D) PSM is computationally more expensive than Deep Learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer: B\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: PSM can only balance variables that you have in your dataset. If \"motivation\" is a confounder but you didn't measure it, PSM treats highly motivated people and lazy people as \"matches\" if their other data points are the same, leading to bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic 3: Advanced Methods & Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 11: Instrumental Variables (IV)\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: In an IV analysis, a variable $Z$ is a valid instrument for treatment $T$ on outcome $Y$ if it satisfies two conditions. One is \"Relevance\" ($Z$ affects $T$). What is the other?\n",
    "\n",
    "A) Exclusion Restriction: $Z$ affects $Y$ only through $T$ (no direct path $Z \\rightarrow Y$).\n",
    "\n",
    "B) Matching: $Z$ must be equal for all participants.\n",
    "\n",
    "C) High Variance: $Z$ must have a large standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "D) Linearity: The relationship between $T$ and $Y$ must be linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer: A\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: The Exclusion Restriction is the core assumption of IV. If the instrument affects the outcome directly (or through another path), it is not isolating the \"clean\" variation in treatment, and the causal estimate will be invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 12: Refutation Tests (DoWhy)\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: In the DoWhy library, what is the purpose of a \"Placebo Treatment Refuter\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "A) To replace the outcome variable with random noise and see if the effect disappears.\n",
    "\n",
    "B) To replace the treatment variable with a random variable; the estimated causal effect should drop to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "C) To remove all control units and re-run the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "D) To test if the code runs faster with fewer data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer: B\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: A robustness check. If we assign a \"fake\" random treatment to people, it shouldn't cause any change in the outcome. If our model detects a \"significant effect\" for a random placebo, our original model is likely overfitting or capturing spurious noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 13: Causal graphs (DAGs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: . In this DAG, if we observe that the grass is wet, knowing that it Rained makes it less likely that the Sprinkler was on. This \"explaining away\" phenomenon is an example of:\n",
    "\n",
    "A) D-separation\n",
    "\n",
    "B) Collider Bias (or Berkson's Paradox)\n",
    "\n",
    "C) The Front-door Criterion\n",
    "\n",
    "D) Instrumental Variable Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer: B\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: \"Wet Grass\" is a collider. Rain and Sprinkler are independent causes. However, once we condition on the collider (observe Wet Grass), the causes become negatively correlated (if it rained, the sprinkler probably wasn't needed).\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 14: Difference-in-Differences (DiD)\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: Which assumption is most critical for the validity of a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) design?\n",
    "\n",
    "A) Parallel Trends Assumption: In the absence of treatment, the treated and control groups would have followed the same trend over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "B) Random Assignment Assumption: Units must be randomly assigned to years.\n",
    "\n",
    "C) Linearity Assumption: The treatment effect must be constant across time.\n",
    "\n",
    "D) Zero Correlation Assumption: The treatment must not be correlated with time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer: A\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: DiD compares the change in the treated group to the change in the control group. This is only valid if we assume the control group provides a valid counterfactual trend for what would have happened to the treated group without the intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 15: Interpretation of Confidence Intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: You estimate a causal effect of $5.2$ with a 95% confidence interval of $[-0.5, 10.9]$. What should you conclude?\n",
    "\n",
    "A) The treatment definitely works and has a positive effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "B) The effect is statistically significant because the mean is positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "C) We cannot rule out the possibility that the true causal effect is zero (the result is not statistically significant at $p < 0.05$).\n",
    "\n",
    "D) The true effect is exactly 5.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer: C\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: Because the confidence interval includes zero (it ranges from negative to positive), we cannot reject the null hypothesis. The data does not provide strong enough evidence to claim a non-zero causal effect at the 95% confidence level."
